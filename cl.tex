My name is Daniel Christiansen and I’m a recent Portland State graduate.  I majored in Computer Engineering and minored in Computer Science.  I’m interested in talking to you about how I can add to your team.

In school, my focus was on computer architecture and design.  Through my coursework, I have experience with the fundamentals of logic design and verification, microprocessor architecture, and VLSI design.  I have experience with a number of tools such as ModelSim and Cadence Virtuoso, as well as languages such as C, Verilog, and Python.  The focus of my senior year was larger team projects that emphasized good design and coding practices.

My capstone project was implementing a flight controller for a quadcopter on an FPGA.  My teammates and I implemented the logic to interpret control signals from the receiver, and sensor data from an IMU to produce stable, controllable flight.  We’ve continued to work on this project after finishing school, and in our spare time are working on adding more features, including alternate flight modes and GPS assisted navigation.

What I have to offer Intel is not only my keen interest in the design and verification of integrated circuits, but my ability to work well as part of a team of enthusiastic and skilled people.  With both the time and experience of a degree under my belt, I am excited to delve into the application of my studies by joining the team at Intel.
